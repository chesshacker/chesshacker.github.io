<p class="lead" markdown="1">Hiring the right people is more important in software development than in most professions.  To be competitive, you need to hire the best people you can find.  Fortunately, you have come to the right place!</p>

I have a lot to offer Rackspace including a M.S. in Computer Science and 15 years of software development experience.  My experience covers every aspect of the software development process and projects of all sizes.  For the past four years, I have supported the Navy's largest unmanned aircraft system to date as a subject matter expert in flight controls software.  This position gives me a complete view of the software development process, as my responsibilities include developing system requirements, overseeing software development, reviewing software artifacts, evaluating contractor performance, trouble-shooting software issues, recommending bug-fixes, and evaluating the software aspects of the flight control system for airworthiness certification.  For three years prior, I served as a subject matter expert in the guidance software for a major weapon program.  This position included similar duties, plus I led a six-person team, mentored junior programmers, led a formal software simulation accreditation effort, and developed various tools and simulations to support the team's work.  Before that, I developed the real-time software for an autonomous ground vehicle which is now used as a high-speed, maneuverable target by several military bases.  My work experience hasn't always been in the defense industry though.  For six years, I developed a wide-range of database-intensive business solutions.  Most of this work was on small projects, where I was solely responsible for developing the requirements, estimating the effort, implementing proof of concept, developing the design and creating the final product.

I have experience in over a dozen programming languages and many different technologies.  At Rackspace, I could see myself very successfully working with Python, Ruby or Java.  I taught myself Java in 1999 and used it extensively for a couple years during the dot-com boom.  I learned Ruby six years ago when I wanted to test out Ruby on Rails 2.0 and see how it compared to other web application frameworks.  Ruby turned out to be one of my favorite languages and I have used it for many small tasks and programs since then, including a communications simulation and part of a missile simulation.  About two years ago, I learned Python and Django; neither immediately swept me away from Ruby and Rails.  Recently however, I have been using Python more often than Ruby for small programs at home and work, including a program to receive and save telemetry via UDP sockets.  That said, professionally, I have not spent great amounts of time programming with either Python or Ruby (most of my career has required C programming), but I have used both languages enough at home and occasionally at work that I am very comfortable with either one.  Following is a partial list of technologies I have experience with:

* Languages: C, Ruby, Python, Objective-C, Java, C++, Fortran, Ada, Lisp, Turbo Pascal, Lex and Yacc
* Web Design: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Prototype, Scriptaculous and Bootstrap
* Databases: MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, FrontBase and FileMaker
* Web application frameworks: Ruby on Rails, WebObjects and Lasso
* Operating Systems: Mac OS X, Ubuntu Linux, VxWorks, CentOS, Solaris 8 and Solaris 10
* Version Control: Git, Subversion, CVS and Perforce
* Virtualization: OpenStack and VirtualBox

For 13 years, I have studied, practiced and advocated Agile programming practices.  Since my first encounter with Extreme Programming in 2000, I began to reflect on and improve the way I developed software.  I even applied test driven development to my work on real-time, embedded systems, which are not often developed with Agile methods.  I have also changed the way Northrop Grumman develops and tests their flight controls software, insisting on clean code and repeatedly recommending they automate their qualification testing.  My recommendations directly resulted in a better product, and contributed to an enterprise-wide decision to automate testing.

I hope you find this portfolio of my work to be helpful as you consider my application.  This page serves as an introduction and cover letter.  You can find more information on the other pages of this website by using the navigation bar at the top of the page or by clicking these links:

* [Chess Demo](/sample-work/chess-openings/) shows the Chess Toolkit in action as part of a Ruby on Rails web application

* [Business Solutions](/experience/business/) describes the work I did for Quetzal Consulting and Texas A&M University

I am really excited about the possibility of working at Rackspace and living in San Antonio.  I have been following the OpenStack project and even dedicated a home computer to learning OpenStack.  I realize my career is not typical of a Racker, but there is power in diversity and I believe my unique experiences will greatly benefit your team.  I look forward for a chance to meet with you to discuss your current needs and how I can help.

Sincerely,
