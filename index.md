I have over 17 years of experience helping people solve problems through
software. I enjoy working with teams to figure out the bigger picture and then
coming up with useful technical solutions. I love that there is a new challenge
every day and there is always more to learn. When a new idea strikes early in
the morning, I can hardly wait to get into the office and explore it. By the end
of most days, I return home energized by my teammates and our achievements.

My breadth of experience is now my greatest strength. I started my journey
developing database-intensive business applications and websites. Then I spent a
decade working with real-time, safety-critical software in autonomous trucks,
missiles and planes. Two years ago, I returned to the private sector and to my
roots, developing web applications. During my career, I have worked on
everything from short one-person projects to massive multi-billion dollar
programs. My roles varied included individual software developer, team leader,
systems engineer and subject matter expert responsible for the entire software
development process. Technologies have ranged from old VAX systems running
Fortran to Docker containers running microservices, each one presenting
opportunities to expand my skill set. I have also had the benefit and pleasure
of working with and learning from so many incredibly talented developers,
leaders and world-class experts along the way.

I am currently interested in new opportunities to make a meaningful difference
in an expanding business. If you are looking for an experienced software
developer to lead a team or to solve tough problems, please contact me through
[email][email] or [LinkedIn][linkedin]. I am eager to talk about possibilities.

I hope you find this website to be helpful. This page is only the beginning.
There is more information about my work at [Rackspace][rackspace],
[NAVAIR][navair] and beyond. You may also find some of my sample work like the
[Chess Opening Explorer][chess] to be interesting.
