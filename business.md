<p class="lead" markdown="1">Prior to working for NAVAIR, I developed database-intensive business solutions for six years.  My story began at Texas A&M University.  I was a sophomore, studying to become a Mechanical Engineer, and the thought of developing software professionally had never crossed my mind when I found the Department of Food Services was looking for a student worker to do data entry.  I could type like the wind, so I got the job!  Soon after I started work, I learned everything I could about FileMaker databases, and my supervisor realized I could help them more by developing applications than entering data.  Thus, in the Fall of 1997, I began my first job as a professional software developer.</p>

By the Spring of 1999, my junior year, I still planned to become a Mechanical Engineer, but I was really enjoying my work and I had learned to do just about anything with FileMaker.  That's when I began to work freelance for a small dot-com company in Silicon Valley, Quetzal Consulting, also known as MedicalHost.com.  The work was challenging, the pay was great, and the Dept. of Food Services was very accommodating with my schedule.  So, I was working two jobs (~30 hours / week) and going to school full-time.  Somehow, I graduated in just four years with honors.  Unfortunately, it took me four years to figure out I should have been studying Computer Science!  It was too late to change majors, and it didn't seem to matter in the dot-com world.

After graduation, I began working for Quetzal Consulting as a salaried employee.  This was a great time!  I worked many more projects, and I loved to help customers find new ways of solving their business problems.  Although I started work as a FileMaker developer, I quickly learned to develop web-based solutions using WebObjects, Java, Oracle, and Solaris... not bad for a Mechanical Engineer.  And that's when I realized, if I was really going to develop software for a living, I wanted a degree in Computer Science.  I said farewell to my friends at Quetzal and moved back to College Station.  I was used to a salary, so my original plan was to do freelance work full-time and go to school part-time; but with the burst of the dot-com bubble, I changed plans.  I began my M.S. in Computer Science in January of 2002, working two part-time jobs, as a teaching assistant and once again for the Department of Food Services.  Two years later, I had my degree and a few more small projects to my name.

Following is a partial list of projects I worked on.

## Quetzal Consulting Projects

### Call Center Management - MedicalHost

MedicalHost's primary product, Marvin, was a call center management solution for pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide consumers and health care professionals with accurate information concerning their products.  The system facilitated recording and responding to requests for medical information.  I was one of several WebObjects developers.  Being new on the team, I was to support the lead developers by correcting bugs and adding minor features.  It was a great way to learn the software and immediately add value to the team.

### Online Reverse Auction - Tonic 360

This WebObjects application helped Tonic 360 to find the lowest bid per impression for various advertising campaigns that they ran.  The program managed these campaigns, the participants and their bids.  After the campaign had been created and participants had been added to the campaign, Tonic 360 staff could easily send a personalized invitation to all the participants.  This invitation included a hyperlink for the participant to join the auction, place bids and see the lowest bid in dollars per thousand impressions.  The program included several reports to help decide the winning participants and many other features.  I was the sole developer for this project.

### Organic Produce Delivery Management - The Box

This solution tracked customers, orders, deliveries, online sales, payments, produce supply, and customer relations.  The web-based portion showed the current supply of produce, allowed visitors to become members, and maintained customer profiles including produce preferences, delivery schedules and custom orders.  The client/server piece was used to maintain delivery routes, generate assembly instructions, control available supply, enter payment information, bill clients, validate account changes before they become effective, and track account changes.  I was one of the principal developers.  I wrote the majority of the client/server interface using FileMaker and the web interface with Lasso.  Other developers supported web design and credit card processing.  This was my first project incorporating the *Extreme Programming* elements relating to customer interaction, and it proved very successful.

### Laboratory Information Management - Incyte Genomics

This client-server solution managed the primer walk and shotgun processes which occur prior to the sequencing of DNA.  The two major parts of this solution were a complete freezer inventory management system and a flexible meta-data model for the actual process after the clones were reracked.  This solution included many complex procedures and highly customized interfaces specific to each process.  I was one of several developers to support this FileMaker project, but I earned a reputation as a super hero for swooping in and saving the day at a time when this project was running behind schedule and over budget.

### Real Estate Due Diligence Management - National Assessment Corp.

This web-based system known as NAC-WEB was a legacy system that used a combination of Claris Dynamic Markup Language (CDML) and Lasso.  My role was to improve the performance of this system, changing the pages from CDML to Lasso.

### FileMaker Solutions Alliance Membership Management - FileMaker, Inc.

The web interface of this solution allowed the public to search for consultants and solutions directly from the FileMaker, Inc. web site.  It also permitted Solutions Alliance members to apply for membership and control their membership information through a private web interface.  Prior to being viewable on the public web site, changes were passed by a 'one-click' approval mechanism.  I was one of several developers on this project and was primarily responsible for the web interface.  While I was at the FileMaker headquarters, I took the FSA written test on behalf of Quetzal Consulting as part of our membership requirements, and I aced it.

### Online Ordering and Order Processing - Pyramid Printing & Graphics

The ordering aspect of this system collected printing requirements via the web, verified the order by displaying a custom preview to the customer, and provided real-time order status tracking.  The custom preview was generated from FileMaker Pro's Web Companion via FileMaker scripts, Apple Events and QuarkXPress.  A similar procedure was later used to generate typesets for each order.  The way in which this was done gave Pyramid astounding adaptability to generate custom templates.  For each order they typeset, a tracking sheet was generated and a barcode scanner was used to quickly track the order progress after printing and shipping.  Once a company's orders had been shipped, it generated one invoice per cost center.  I was the sole developer on this project and developed it while I was still in school.

## Texas A&M University Projects

Thinking back now, I can't recall which of these I developed alone and which I worked on with my supervisor and friend, Mark Crooks.  It was a lot of fun working with Mark, and we would often call each other over to say, "check this out."

### Catering Event Scheduler

The Department of Food Services at Texas A&M University has several managing units that cater University-related events.  This solution allowed multiple units to independently schedule their events, complete event agreements, search previous events, and manage upcoming events.  Catering administrators had privileges to search and modify any catering event within the department.  For audit purposes, accountability was crucial; thus, the solution kept careful track of the last user to modify any event, and required Accounting's approval to officially cancel any orders.  The Accounting Department also used this solution to generate invoices and manage their client list.

### Employee Relations Manager

The Department of Human Resources chose several departments to participate in a new management program called the Positive Performance Management System.  This solution computerized the paper logs, employee tracking, and the rules for putting an employee on notice.  In minutes, FileMaker generated the reports required by this management system, saving the personnel department days of tedious calculations.  Another feature of this program was the online tutorial to familiarize new users with many of the routine tasks.

### Employee Training Manager

The training department of Food Services created a new system by which to train employees and help them advance in pay levels.  This database solution tracked the courses taken and the credits earned by all Food Services employees.  Each employee could select between four career tracks, each of which had different requirements to advance in levels.  The training department controlled both the track requirements and employee attendance/credit through a user-friendly database interface.  They could also print several types of reports to keep management and employees informed.

### Franchise Sales Tracking

The Department of Food Services sells food through various franchises, all of which require detailed reporting of sales.  At the end of every month, this program would generate comprehensive weekly and monthly total sales reports for each franchise, clearly indicating the monthly franchise fee, based on their sales.

### Menu Tracking

This database solution tracked the menu and the nutritional information for all the main courses.  Every morning it automatically generated web pages containing menus for the current day and upcoming week, along with detailed nutritional information.  It also printed the daily menus for each facility.
