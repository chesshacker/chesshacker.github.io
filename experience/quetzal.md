<p class="lead" markdown="1">After graduation, I began working for Quetzal Consulting as a salaried employee.  This was a great time!</p>

I worked many more projects, and I loved to help customers find new ways of solving their business problems.  Although I started work as a FileMaker developer, I quickly learned to develop web-based solutions using WebObjects, Java, Oracle, and Solaris... not bad for a Mechanical Engineer.

That's when I realized, if I was really going to develop software for a living, I wanted a degree in Computer Science.  I said farewell to my friends at Quetzal and moved back to College Station.  I was used to a salary, so my original plan was to do freelance work full-time and go to school part-time; but with the burst of the dot-com bubble, I changed plans.  I began my M.S. in Computer Science in January of 2002, working two part-time jobs, as a teaching assistant and once again for the Department of Food Services.  Two years later, I had my degree and a few more small projects to my name.

Following is a partial list of projects I worked on for Quetzal Consulting.

### Call Center Management - MedicalHost

MedicalHost's primary product, Marvin, was a call center management solution for pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide consumers and health care professionals with accurate information concerning their products.  The system facilitated recording and responding to requests for medical information.  I was one of several WebObjects developers.  Being new on the team, I was to support the lead developers by correcting bugs and adding minor features.  It was a great way to learn the software and immediately add value to the team.

### Online Reverse Auction - Tonic 360

This WebObjects application helped Tonic 360 to find the lowest bid per impression for various advertising campaigns that they ran.  The program managed these campaigns, the participants and their bids.  After the campaign had been created and participants had been added to the campaign, Tonic 360 staff could easily send a personalized invitation to all the participants.  This invitation included a hyperlink for the participant to join the auction, place bids and see the lowest bid in dollars per thousand impressions.  The program included several reports to help decide the winning participants and many other features.  I was the sole developer for this project.

### Organic Produce Delivery Management - The Box

This solution tracked customers, orders, deliveries, online sales, payments, produce supply, and customer relations.  The web-based portion showed the current supply of produce, allowed visitors to become members, and maintained customer profiles including produce preferences, delivery schedules and custom orders.  The client/server piece was used to maintain delivery routes, generate assembly instructions, control available supply, enter payment information, bill clients, validate account changes before they become effective, and track account changes.  I was one of the principal developers.  I wrote the majority of the client/server interface using FileMaker and the web interface with Lasso.  Other developers supported web design and credit card processing.  This was my first project incorporating the *Extreme Programming* elements relating to customer interaction, and it proved very successful.

### Laboratory Information Management - Incyte Genomics

This client-server solution managed the primer walk and shotgun processes which occur prior to the sequencing of DNA.  The two major parts of this solution were a complete freezer inventory management system and a flexible meta-data model for the actual process after the clones were reracked.  This solution included many complex procedures and highly customized interfaces specific to each process.  I was one of several developers to support this FileMaker project, but I earned a reputation as a super hero for swooping in and saving the day at a time when this project was running behind schedule and over budget.

### Real Estate Due Diligence Management - National Assessment Corp.

This web-based system known as NAC-WEB was a legacy system that used a combination of Claris Dynamic Markup Language (CDML) and Lasso.  My role was to improve the performance of this system, changing the pages from CDML to Lasso.

### FileMaker Solutions Alliance Membership Management - FileMaker, Inc.

The web interface of this solution allowed the public to search for consultants and solutions directly from the FileMaker, Inc. web site.  It also permitted Solutions Alliance members to apply for membership and control their membership information through a private web interface.  Prior to being viewable on the public web site, changes were passed by a 'one-click' approval mechanism.  I was one of several developers on this project and was primarily responsible for the web interface.  While I was at the FileMaker headquarters, I took the FSA written test on behalf of Quetzal Consulting as part of our membership requirements, and I aced it.

### Online Ordering and Order Processing - Pyramid Printing & Graphics

The ordering aspect of this system collected printing requirements via the web, verified the order by displaying a custom preview to the customer, and provided real-time order status tracking.  The custom preview was generated from FileMaker Pro's Web Companion via FileMaker scripts, Apple Events and QuarkXPress.  A similar procedure was later used to generate typesets for each order.  The way in which this was done gave Pyramid astounding adaptability to generate custom templates.  For each order they typeset, a tracking sheet was generated and a barcode scanner was used to quickly track the order progress after printing and shipping.  Once a company's orders had been shipped, it generated one invoice per cost center.  I was the sole developer on this project and developed it while I was still in school.
