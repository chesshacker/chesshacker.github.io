The first five years were at China Lake in the [Weapons Division][nawcwd] and
the next five were at Pax River in the [Aircraft Division.][nawcad]

### [MQ-4C Triton][triton]

The Navy's newest unmanned Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR)
aircraft platform.  From 2009 to 2014, I supported the Persistent Maritime
Unmanned Aircraft Systems Program Office as the Flight Controls Software Subject
Matter Expert.  I worked with an integrated team of contractors, Navy civilians
and military to develop the Triton system from their existing RQ-4B Global Hawk.
My responsibilities included developing system requirements, overseeing software
development, reviewing software artifacts, evaluating contractor performance,
and conducting engineering investigations.  I am glad to report that after four
years on the program and many days on travel, Triton successfully completed
[first flight][first] on May 22, 2013!  For my direct contributions to this
achievement, I was individually recognized by the program manager, Capt. Hoke,
and the Program Executive Office lead, Rear Adm. Winter.  Additionally, my team
was awarded the Air Vehicle Engineering Department Director's Award, an annual
award that recognizes a team within the Air Vehicle Engineering Community that
exhibits team accomplishments and significant achievements that exemplify
teamwork, technical acumen, and overall solutions-oriented approaches to
customer support.

### [AGM/RGM-84D Harpoon][harpoon]

The Navy's premier all-weather, over-the-horizon, anti-ship missile system.
After three years supporting the Harpoon/SLAM-ER Technical Project Office in
general, and significant effort on the Harpoon Block III upgrade in particular,
the Navy decided to cancel the upgrade program.  During my time with Harpoon, I
supported many different activities, including: systems engineering, simulation
development, simulation accreditation, formal qualification testing, integration
testing, flight test, data analysis, subject matter expert, and team lead.  I
was very fortunate to work with a remarkable team, including some of the
greatest weapons experts in the Navy.  Prior to the program's cancellation, I
was honored to receive special recognition by the Project Office for my
outstanding support and leadership.  I am glad to report that my three years
supporting the Harpoon upgrade were not in vain.  The Harpoon Block III program
was eventually reborn as Harpoon Block II+ and recently completed a successful
[live fire test.][fire]

### [Shootable Remote Threat Ground Target (SRTGT)][srtgt]

Semi-autonomous truck used in weapons testing.  I was part of a small Navy team
that did the original design and development of this project.  Our goal was to
create a highly maneuverable ground target for use on weapons-testing ranges.
The problem with existing targets was that they were remote controlled and the
delay during operation made them difficult to maneuver.  Our solution was to
manually drive the routes once, and then we could command the vehicle to
*autonomously* repeat the course.  I was the principal developer of the
vehicle's control software, which was written in C and runs on the VxWorks RTOS.
This was a really fun and fast-paced project, reminiscent of my dot-com days.
One aspect of the software development I am especially proud of is the
*test-driven development* approach I used during development.  After one year,
we successfully built two trucks and demonstrated the system.  I left the
program to support Harpoon just as SRTGT was transitioning from development to
production.  If you watch this NAVAIR recruiting video, you will see my truck
blown up three times (at 2:15, 2:33 and 2:40), and its control computer being
installed (2:59).
