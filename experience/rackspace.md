Rackspace has these amazing [core values][core-values] that make work fantastic.
At Rackspace, employees are known as *Rackers,* and treating Rackers like
*friends and family* is one my favorite core values. My teammates and the other
Rackers I have worked with really do live this value well, and it makes going to
work very enjoyable.

At Rackspace, my job has been and is currently, Lead Software Developer for
Self-Service. Self-Service is a small team dedicated to providing customers with
the information they need to tackle problems on their own. By helping to answer
customer's questions online, before they call or chat with a support Racker, our
team reduces support costs. Also, by empowering customers to do more on their
own, they use more of our products, which brings in revenue.

### The Simpler, The Better

When I started, I was quickly introduced to a wide range of platforms we
supported, and learned an even wider range of technologies to support them all.
Our [support hub][support] used [MoonScript][moonscript], [Lua][lua],
[Lapis][lapis] and [PostgreSQL][postgres]. Our *Knowledge Center* used
[Drupal][drupal], [PHP][php] and [MySQL][mysql]. Our *Launch Guides* used
[Slim][slim], PHP and [MongoDB][mongo]. Our [API Docs][docs] used [Java Servlets
with JSP][java], [Maven][maven], [Nexus][nexus], [DocBook][docbook] and
[WADL][wadl]. Our analytics platform used [Adobe Marketing Cloud][adobe] and
[Tealium][tealium]. Our [Community][community] forum used
[Telligent][telligent], [.NET][dot-net] and [Velocity script][velocity]. We also
supported several internal tools. A mapping tool used [Ruby][ruby] on
[Rails][rails], and an internal documentation tool used [Chicago Boss][boss] and
[Erlang][erlang]. Being web-applications, they all naturally used [HTML][html],
[CSS][css] and [JavaScript][javascript] and [jQuery.][jquery]

As you can imagine, that's a lot for anyone to manage, and I didn't become an
expert in every one of these platforms, but I did some work in all. One of my
goals was to unify and simplify our systems, reducing the number of technologies
used, so our team could work more efficiently.

Over the past two years, I have been successful at shedding the crazier
technologies and reducing the number of platforms we support. We passed the
internal tools to another team, since that was outside our team's mission. We
also migrated almost all the other web properties to a single documentation
platform, known as [deconst,][deconst] which was developed largely by another
team at Rackspace. By working with this other team, it freed up my team to focus
on the aspects most relevant to our website, content and writers.

You can see the result of this work online. API docs was the first site we began
migrating. You can see *most* of the books are now in [Developer
Docs.][dev-docs]. The last few books will be migrated soon. [Support
hub][support] was next, and lastly, the [How-To][how-to] Site replaced our
Knowledge Center.

The new platform uses quite a few technologies as well, including
[Node.js][node], [Python][python], [Ruby][ruby], [Sphinx][sphinx],
[Jekyll][jekyll], [Docker][docker], [Ansible][ansible], [Elasticsearch,
Logstash, Kibana][elk], [MongoDB][mongo] and [Cloud Files][files]. While that
may at first seem like a long list, the use of each technology and the
[microservices architecture][micro] really make this setup much easier to
work with.

### Bringing Home the Gold

While reducing all the complexity is certainly a win, another one of my goals
was to significantly improve the experience for our customers. I did just that
by leading the development of what we call the *Support Drawer.*

The Support Drawer puts all the cloud customer's methods of support in one
easy-to-use place. When customers click the *Support* link from within the cloud
control panel, a drawer slides out from the side of the page giving them options
to select a from a context-sensitive list of articles, search all self-service
content, check system status, start a chat, visit the online community, create a
ticket, or call a Racker. A previous version of the Support Drawer allowed
customers to post their question directly in the community forum, and we had
[SAML][saml] integration with the Community to perform authentication. Another
previous version of the drawer allowed users to click a button and have a Racker
quickly call them. We also helped customers to upgrade their Support Service
Level by adding a banner ad of sorts within the drawer to learn more about
support service levels.

Customers and support Rackers alike have greatly benefited from this new
capability within the cloud control panel. Not only that, but the industry took
notice of it. On February 27, 2015, my team was awarded the [Gold Stevie
Award][stevie] in the IVR or Web Service Solution category.

### Intern Program Management

In addition to my role as Lead Software Developer, I am also known for my
leadership role in the summer intern program at Rackspace. I am responsible for
the interns in the Cloud business unit. This past summer, there were 11 interns
in Cloud, and next summer we plan to hire 15. This requires coordination with
senior leadership, other business units, human resources, hiring managers, and
students.

During the summer, I coordinate activities, teach and mentor the interns. During
the rest of the year, I help recruiting by speaking at events like Texas A&M's
Engineering Industry Seminar, or by talking to students at career fairs. Of
course there is a lot of planning and interviews too.

### Outreach

In addition to helping interns, I enjoy teaching and mentoring other students
and professionals. I have helped mentor at several hackathons. In August, I led
a workshop at the [SoHacks Hackathon][sohacks] on building a website with [GitHub
Pages][pages] and I won an award for being one of the top mentors.

Within Rackspace, I have led several [Coding Dojos][dojo] using both Python and
[Golang][go]. Beyond Rackspace, I have spoken several times at the Alamo Python
Learners Meetup, now [Alamo Code Learners][alamo]. My talk in July 2015 was on
[Python Setuptools and Web Scraping][alamotalk].

Lastly, I do quite a bit of non-coding outreach through [Castle Chess][castle].
Rackspace really supports community outreach. One way they do that is by
providing 24 hours of volunteer time, which I have completely used for the past
two years, teaching an after-school chess program at Encino Park Elementary
School. I also teach chess two other times each week at Encino Branch Library
and Parman Library. This outreach is strictly volunteer, and I enjoy seeing the
kids learn important life skills from this fun and mentally-stimulating game.
